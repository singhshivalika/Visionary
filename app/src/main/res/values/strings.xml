        Welcome to Visionary,
        Are you interested in taking a tour of this app?</string>

    <string name="tutorial">This app has been designed to assist you.
It consists of the 4 features:
1. Navigation System, device vibrates until you get back to the correct path, and notifies to proceed in which direction, and by what angle.
2. Object Detection, detects nearby objects and names them.
3. SOS, it sends SMS to your favourite contacts and plays alarm.
4. Text Recognition, it recognizes text and reads it out.

Now that you\'ve understood what it does.
Let me quickly walk you through how to activate these features:

1. Swipe down to activate Navigation System.
2. Swipe right to detect Objects.
3. Swipe up 8 times in a row to activate SOS.
4. Swipe left to recognize Text.

Also, you can ask your family members to keep a track on you via using another app, Tracker.

Seems pretty easy right. Let\'s dive in.</string>
